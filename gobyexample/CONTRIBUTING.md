## Contributing

Go by Example is now in a steady state. We are maintaining it, but are not
expanding or significantly changing it any more.

With that in mind here are some specific contribution guidelines:

* If you see a typo or would like to suggest another small change, editing the
  .go or .sh source file should be sufficient for the PR. I can rebuild the
  HTML when I review the change.

* We are not going to add any more sections to the site. There are many
  important topics that Go by Example doesn't cover, which we leave to other
  resources.

* We are not going to change the navigation of the site, in particular adding
  a "previous section" link or an "index" link other than the on the title
  text.
