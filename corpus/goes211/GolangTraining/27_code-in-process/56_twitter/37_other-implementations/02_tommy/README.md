## twitter-project aka Screamer

Check out the live site [here!](https://secret-spark-101320.appspot.com)

This was a project I did for the web development bootcamp at Fresno City College. It is meant to be a very simplistic clone of twitter. Users log in with their google account, and then they can post "screams". Everything is stored in the app-engine datastore.
