# How to setup Go and Aerospike in digitalocean Ubuntu 15.10

## Setup Ubuntu user account
1. Create a ssh key
	* unix users
		* at terminal:
			* cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
				* checks to see if you have a key in this location
			* ssh-keygen
				* creates a key
				* if it's production code, set a password
			* cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
				* .pub is the public key
				* never show anyone your private key which was also created
					* it doesn't have an extension, just: id_rsa
	* windows users
		* use putty program; download it from online
1. Setup Github to use your SSH
	* https://github.com/settings/ssh
	* we can give our public key to github
		* this allows us to connect to github and not have to enter a password
		* our machine will send a message to github
			* github will use our public key
			* if it can decrypt the message, no other password is needed
	* at terminal:
		* ssh -T git@github.com
		* Hi GoesToEleven! You've successfully authenticated, but GitHub does not provide shell access.
1. Create a server.
    * create droplet
    * hostname
    	* digital ocean recommends your url, eg, www.mcleods.com-1
    	* use "dash digit" for multiple servers, eg, www.mcleods.com-2 ... www.mcleods.com-9
    * Make sure to set the server to ubuntu 15.10.
    * 32-bit is recommended unless you have more than 4gb of RAM,
    	* EXCEPT for if you use AEROSPIKE, which requires 64-bit for both main database and API.
    * Make sure you turn on private networking
    	* so you can connect to your database without using up bandwidth.
    * Make sure you have put in an ssh key here
    	* to avoid unsecure password logins.
	* you'll need your IP address
		* once your server is created, you'll see this
		* copy it: eg, 192.241.219.56
1. Connect to server's root account.
    * Use ssh on unix machines.
        * `ssh root@<ip_address>`
        * eg, ssh root@192.241.219.56
    * Make sure you have setup ssh keys with your computer.
    	* which we did above in these notes
    	* Windows user should use putty.
	* after running the `ssh root@<ip_address>` command
		* your terminal is now ON the server
1. Create a user with sudo access.
    * you're logged into the server with full admin access
    * it's better to create a user with more limited access
    	* `adduser <username>`
    	* this creates a folder with the username
    	* the user has access to that folder
    * Make sure to put in a good password!
    * You can leave the other settings blank, just keep pressing enter.
    * Give the user sudo access.
        * `gpasswd -a <username> sudo`
1. Add ssh key access to new user account.
    * Flip your access to the new user.
        * `su <username>`
    * Move to the home directory.
        * `cd`
    * Create folder and restrict access to only yourself.
        * `mkdir .ssh`
        * `chmod 700 .ssh`
    * Create a file and add ssh key to it.
        * `nano .ssh/authorized_keys`
        * Paste key into file and save and exit with Ctrl-X.
        	* cat ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
            * Ctrl-Shift-V for unix users to paste.
            * Right-click in window to paste for putty.
    * Restrict the permissions of the file.
        * `chmod 600 .ssh/authorized_keys`
    * Return to root.
        * `exit`
    * Test if it worked.
        * Connect to your new account with either putty or ssh
            * `ssh <username>@<ip_address>`
        * If it asks for your password, something went wrong.
1. Restrict ssh access to root and password connections.
    * As root, edit the settings in the ssh config file.
        * `nano /etc/ssh/sshd_config`
        * Set the line `PermitRootLogin` to no to disable root login.
        * Set the line `PasswordAuthentication` to no to disable logging in with a password.
            * Make sure to uncomment the line as well.
        * Restart the ssh service.
          * `service ssh restart`
    * Make sure you test if you can still access it with normal connection
    	* BEFORE you disconnect the root terminal.
    		* new tab in terminal
    		* ssh <username>@IP, eg, ssh todd@192.241.219.56
    * And test that the root login really is disabled.
    		* ssh root@192.241.219.56

## Setup additional helpful items
1. Setup firewall.
    * Allow ssh through the firewall.
        * this way
        	* `sudo ufw allow ssh`
        * OR
        	* `sudo ufw allow 22/tcp`
    * Examine the rules.
        * `sudo ufw show added`
    * If everything looks right, enable the firewall.
        * `sudo ufw enable`
    * Make sure everything is running right.
        * `sudo ufw status`
1. Synchronize the system clock.
    * Set timezone.
        * `sudo dpkg-reconfigure tzdata`
        * A graphical menu will allow you to choose a city to sync time with.
    * Install NTP
        * If you have not used apt-get yet, run `sudo apt-get update`
        	* apt-get is a package manager for debian unix and above
        * `sudo apt-get install ntp`
        * ntp will automatically place enable run on boot.
1. Create a swapspace.
    * Reserve the space.
        * `sudo fallocate -l <size> /swapfile`
        * `<size>` is something like `1G` or `512M`
        	* recommended size: equal or double your RAM
    * Restrict access to root only.
        * `sudo chmod 600 /swapfile`
    * Configure into a swapfile.
        * `sudo mkswap /swapfile`
    * Start using the swapfile.
        * `sudo swapon /swapfile`
    * Setup automatically using the swapfile on boot.
        * `sudo sh -c 'echo "/swapfile none swap sw 0 0" >> /etc/fstab'`
1. This is a good point to make a snapshot of your server.
    * Shut the server down.
        * `sudo poweroff`
    * Save a snapshot in the digitalocean console.
    	* goto www.digitalocean.com
    	* make the snapshot
    		* go into your server
    		* refresh until "OFF"
    		* take snapshot

## Get a Go server running
1. (optional) install Go.
    * If you have Go 1.5 or newer, you can cross compile most programs and transfer the executable.
    	* at terminal:
			* go
				* see all of the go commands
			* go help environment
			* you can set your build on your dev machine for your destination machine
				* eg, GOOS=linux GOARCH=amd64 go build
				* you could then take your binary and run it on your destination machine
    * Some packages still require a native Go install to build though.
    * Download Go.
        * `wget <url>`
        * The url for 1.5.1 is `https://storage.googleapis.com/golang/go1.5.1.linux-amd64.tar.gz`
        * eg, `wget https://storage.googleapis.com/golang/go1.5.1.linux-amd64.tar.gz`
    * Extract Go from the archive file.
        * `tar -xzf <filename>`
        	* x is for extract
        	* z is for giz
        	* f is for file
    * Move Go to the default install location.
        * `sudo mv go /usr/local/go`
    * Change owner to root and alter permissions.
        * `sudo chown -R root:root /usr/local/go`
        * `sudo chmod 755 /usr/local/go`
    * Create workspace folder.
    	* cd ~
        * `mkdir <workspace_name>{,/bin,/pkg,/src}`
        	* eg, `mkdir goworkspace{,/bin,/pkg,/src}`
    * Edit environment variables.
    	* `sudo nano /etc/profile`
        	* Add `export PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/go/bin` to `/etc/profile` file
        * cd ~
        * nano ~/.profile
			* Add `export GOPATH=$HOME/<workspace_name>` to `~/.profile` file
			* Add `export PATH=$HOME/<workspace_name>/bin:$PATH` to `~/.profile`
    * Delete the go archive file.
        * `rm <filename>`
        	* eg, `rm go1.5.1.linux-amd64.tar.gz`
    * Install git.
        * `sudo apt-get install git`
    * Reconnect to the server to allow environment variables to update.
1. Adjust firewall to allow http connections.
    * Allow http through the firewall.
        * `sudo ufw allow http`
        * OR `sudo ufw allow 80/tcp`
    * Allow https through the firewall, if needed.
        * `sudo ufw allow https`
        * or `sudo ufw allow 443/tcp`
	* Run this to make sure the rules got added
		* `sudo ufw status`
1. Setup haproxy (high availability proxy)
    * Install haproxy.
        * `sudo apt-get install haproxy`
    * Configure haproxy.
        * Edit this `/etc/haproxy/haproxy.cfg` with sudo nano
        	* eg, `sudo nano /etc/haproxy/haproxy.cfg`
        * Add to the default section:
         	* `retries 3`
			* `option redispatch`
			* Add the following block to the end of the file:
```
listen app 0.0.0.0:80
	mode http
	option http-server-close
	timeout http-keep-alive 3000
	server serv 127.0.0.1:9000 check
```

    * More information available [here](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-use-haproxy-to-set-up-http-load-balancing-on-an-ubuntu-vps).
  * Reload haproxy
    * `sudo service haproxy reload`
1. Get your code onto the server.
    * secure copy to copy your files over:
		* WINDOWS
			* use WinSCP
		* UNIX machine
			* use scp:
				* `scp <source> <destination>`
					* Add -rp if it is a folder you are transfering.
					* `scp -rp <source> <destination>`
				* The format for remote connections is `<username>@<ip_address>:<path>`
					* Example: `scp -rp ~/Desktop/testServer daniel@107.170.246.157:~/testServer`
					* Another Example: `scp -rp 01_helloWorld/ todd@192.241.219.56:~/01_helloWorld`
		* Make sure it is built, whether on your system or on the server directly.
			* on your server:
				* go run testServer.go
1. Configure systemd.
	* systemd is system daemon
		* like all good demons, system daemon does not require direct supervision
		* this means we can shut off our dev machine and the website will still serve
	* wikipedia:
		* In multitasking computer operating systems, a daemon (/ˈdiːmən/ or /ˈdeɪmən/)[1] is a computer program that runs as a background process, rather than being under the direct control of an interactive user. Traditionally daemon names end with the letter d. For example, syslogd is the daemon that implements the system logging facility, and sshd is a daemon that services incoming SSH connections.
    * Create configuration file: `sudo nano /etc/systemd/system/<filename>.service`
    	* eg, `sudo nano /etc/systemd/system/serveityo.service`
    * Add the following code to the file:
    ```
[Unit]
Description=Go Server

[Service]
ExecStart=/home/<username>/<exepath>
WorkingDirectory=/home/<username>/<exefolderpath>
User=<username>
Group=<username>
Restart=always

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
    ```

    * eg,
    ```
[Unit]
Description=Go Server

[Service]
ExecStart=/home/todd/01_helloWorld/01_helloWorld
WorkingDirectory=/home/todd/01_helloWorld
User=todd
Group=todd
Restart=always

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
    ```

    * Add the service to systemd.
        * `sudo systemctl enable <filename>.service`
        * eg, `sudo systemctl enable serveityo.service`
    * Activate the service.
        * `sudo systemctl start <filename>.service`
        * eg, `sudo systemctl start serveityo.service`
    * Check if systemd started it.
        * `sudo systemctl status <filename>.service`
        * eg, `sudo systemctl status serveityo.service`
    * if you get this ERROR:
    	* Failed to start Go Server.
    	* make sure you build your file:
    		* go build
    * More information about systemd commands can be found [here](http://www.linux.com/learn/tutorials/788613-understanding-and-using-systemd/).
    * Check if the server is running with your web-browser, just use the server ip address as the url.

## Setup Aerospike server
1. Download and install Aerospike.
  * Aerospike only works for 64-bit machines unless you build it from source yourself, and recommends at least 2gb of RAM.
  * You can get step-by-step instructions for installation [here](http://www.aerospike.com/get-started/#/linux).
  * Download the archive file.
    * `wget -O aerospike.tgz 'http://aerospike.com/download/server/latest/artifact/ubuntu12'`
  * Extract the archive file.
    * `tar -xvf aerospike.tgz`
  * Go into the directory on run the installer.
    * `cd aerospike-server-community-<enter your version here>-ubuntu12`
    	* eg, `cd aerospike-server-community-3.6.4-ubuntu12.04/`
    * `sudo ./asinstall`
  * Allow the database port through the firewall.
  	* you don't need this if you're running everything on the same server:
    	* `sudo ufw allow in on eth1 to any port 3000 proto tcp`
  * Start the service.
    * `sudo service aerospike start`
    * Check when it is ready with: `sudo tail -f /var/log/aerospike/aerospike.log | grep cake`
    	* ctrl+c
    	* stops monitoring the file with tail
  * Delete the aerospike install files.
    * rm -rf aerospike*
1. Install Aerospike management server (optional).
  * Install python2.x, python development libraries, and gcc
    * `sudo apt-get install python gcc python-dev`
  * Download the package file.
    * `wget -O amc.deb http://www.aerospike.com/download/amc/latest/artifact/ubuntu12`
  * Install the server.
    * `sudo dpkg -i amc.deb`
  * Allow the server port through the firewall.
    * `sudo ufw allow 8081/tcp`
  * Start the server.
    * `sudo /etc/init.d/amc start`
  * Examine the amc in your web-browser, address is: `<server_ip>:8081`
  	* eg, `192.241.219.56:8081`
    * When it asks you for the ip of a node, enter the localhost ip: `127.0.0.1`
  * Delete amc install file.
    * `rm amc.deb`
1. Configure Aerospike.
  * Add namespaces as needed.
    * `sudo nano /etc/aerospike/aerospike.conf`
    * At the bottom of the file is the test and bar namespaces, comment them out and use them as examples.
    * This is also the file where you can configure having multiple nodes in a cluster. More information on configuring Aerospike [here](http://www.aerospike.com/docs/operations/configure/network/).
  * Restart Aerospike.
    * `sudo service aerospike restart`

## Get Go Aerospike library and test server
  1. On the server (and your dev machine if you haven't already):
  	* Get the go client library (64-bit only).
    * `go get github.com/aerospike/aerospike-client-go`
  1. Run the benchmark tool, (64-bit only).
    * Change into the client code directory, tools/benchmark
      * `cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/aerospike/aerospike-client-go/tools/benchmark`
    * Run the tool.
      * `go run benchmark.go -h <ip_address>`
      	* eg, `go run benchmark.go -h 127.0.0.1`
      * Note this will only work from a server in digitalocean, since the firewall is configured to only allow connections from eth1, which is the private network.
      * Private ip address can be found with: `ifconfig | grep "inet addr"`, the middle address should be the private one.

## Additional API help
  * The [godoc](https://godoc.org/github.com/aerospike/aerospike-client-go) page is very large, but has everything, including enterprise edition commands.
  * Information on connecting can be found [here](http://www.aerospike.com/docs/client/go/usage/connect/).
  * Information on writing a record, including how to write to a single value in a field and how to set an expiration date for data can be found [here](http://www.aerospike.com/docs/client/go/usage/kvs/write.html).
  * Information on reading a record, including only getting parts of an object, can be found [here](http://www.aerospike.com/docs/client/go/usage/kvs/read.html).
  * Information on queries can be found [here](http://www.aerospike.com/docs/client/go/usage/query/query.html).
  * When you are querying on something, make sure you add a secondary index for that field. You can do that programmatically with Go, or using the Aerospike management server.
