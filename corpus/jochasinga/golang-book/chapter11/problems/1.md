**Why do we use packages?**

Package bundles code for reusing. It reduces the chance of having overlapping names. (Namespacing) This keeps our function names short and concise, organizes code so that its easier to find code for reusing, and speeds up the compiler by only requiring recompilation of smaller chunks of a program. Although we use the package `fmt`, we don't have to recompile it every time we change our program.
