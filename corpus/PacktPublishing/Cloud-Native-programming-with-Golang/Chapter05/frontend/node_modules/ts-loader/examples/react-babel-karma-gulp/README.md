## Getting started

You'll need [node / npm](https://nodejs.org/) installed.  To get up and running just enter:

```
npm install
npm run serve
```

This will:

1. Download the npm packages you need (including the type definitions from DefinitelyTyped)
2. Compile the code and serve it up at [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080)

When you're building for production then `npm run build`
