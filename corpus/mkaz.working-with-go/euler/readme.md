## Project Euler in Go

[Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/) is a series of challenging mathematical/computer programming problems that will require more than just mathematical insights to solve. I use the Project Euler problem set as a way of learning a new language and general fun.

I'm including my solutions in the Go language as part of my "Working with Go" series which includes Go source code to look at and learn from. 

I recommend trying to solve the problems first on your own before turning to the source here. You will learn better if you struggle a little and discover the solutions yourself.
