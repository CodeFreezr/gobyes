## Go by Example

Content and build toolchain for [Go by Example](https://gobyexample.com),
a site that teaches Go via annotated example programs.


### Overview

The Go by Example site is built by extracting code and
comments from source files in `examples` and rendering
them via the `templates` into a static `public`
directory. The programs implementing this build process
are in `tools`, along with some vendor'd dependencies
in `vendor`.

The built `public` directory can be served by any
static content system. The production site uses S3 and
CloudFront, for example.


### Building

To build the site you'll need Go and Python installed. Run:

```console
$ go get github.com/russross/blackfriday
$ tools/build
$ open public/index.html
```

To build continuously in a loop:

```console
$ tools/build-loop
```
