**What's the difference between a method and a function?**

A function is a block of code that maps zero or more input parameters to zero or more output parameters. Functions are also known as procedures or subroutines.

A method is a function that is "owned" or related to an object or a struct, and can be called by an instance with a dot notation. (obj.method())
