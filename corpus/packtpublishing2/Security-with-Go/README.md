# Security with Go
This is the code repository for [Security with Go](https://www.packtpub.com/networking-and-servers/security-go?utm_source=github&utm_medium=repository&utm_campaign=9781788627917), published by [Packt](https://www.packtpub.com/?utm_source=github). It contains all the supporting project files necessary to work through the book from start to finish.
## About the Book
Go is becoming more and more popular as a language for security experts. Its wide use in the server and cloud environment, its speed and ease of use, and its evident capabilities in data analysis have made it a prime choice for developers concerned with security.

Security with Go is the first Golang security book and is useful for both blue team and red team applications. Learn to write secure software, monitor your systems, secure your data, attack systems, and extract information.

Defensive topics include cryptography, forensics, packet capturing, and building secure web applications.

Offensive topics include brute force, port scanning, packet injection, web scraping, social engineering and post exploitation techniques.
## Instructions and Navigation
All of the code is organized into folders. Each folder starts with a number followed by the application name. For example, Chapter02.



The code will look like the following:
```
package main

import (
    "fmt"
)

func main() {
   // Basic for loop
   for i := 0; i < 3; i++ {
       fmt.Println("i:", i)
   }

   // For used as a while loop
   n := 5
   for n < 10 {
       fmt.Println(n)
       n++
   }
}
```

Readers should have basic programming knowledge and understanding of at least one programming language.
To run the examples the reader needs a computer with Go installed. Installation instructions are covered in the book. The recommended operating system is Ubuntu Linux, but examples should also run on macOS, Windows, and other Linux distributions.
