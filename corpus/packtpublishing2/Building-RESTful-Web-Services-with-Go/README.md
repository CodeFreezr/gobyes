# Building RESTful Web services with Go
This is the code repository for [Building RESTful Web services with Go](https://www.packtpub.com/application-development/building-restful-web-services-go?utm_source=github&utm_medium=repository&utm_campaign=9781788294287), published by [Packt](https://www.packtpub.com/?utm_source=github). It contains all the supporting project files necessary to work through the book from start to finish.
## About the Book
Initially, SOAP-based web services became more popular with XML. Then, since 2012,
REST picked up the pace and gulped SOAP in whole. The rise of a new generation of web
languages, such as Python, JavaScript (Node.js), and Go, showed a different approach to
web development compared to the traditional ones, such as ASP.NET and Spring. Since this
decade, Go has become more and more popular due to its speed and intuitiveness. Less
verbose code, strict type checking, and support for concurrency make Go a better choice for
writing any web backend. Some of the best tools, such as Docker and Kubernetes, are
written in Go. Google uses Go a lot in its daily activities. You can see a list of Go-using
companies at https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/GoUsers.
## Instructions and Navigation
All of the code is organized into folders. Each folder starts with a number followed by the application name. For example, Chapter02.



The code will look like the following:
```
{
 "ID": 1,
 "DriverName": "Menaka",
 "OperatingStatus": true
 }
```

For this book, you need a laptop/PC with Linux (Ubuntu 16.04), macOS X, or Windows
installed. We will use Go 1.8+ as the version of our compiler and install many third-party
packages, so a working internet connection is required.
We will also use Docker in the final chapters to explain concepts of API Gateway. Docker
V17.0+ is recommended. If Windows users have problems with the native Go installation
for any examples, use Docker for Windows and run Ubuntu container, which gives more
flexibility; refer to https://www.docker.com/docker-windows for more details.
Before diving into the book, refresh your language basics at https://tour.golang.org/welcome/1.
Even though these are the basic requirements, we will guide you through the installations
wherever required.
