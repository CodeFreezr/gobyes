# Flavours

Mind You: "one size fits all" ain't real - it's just plain nonsense, eagerly popularised by lazy/greedy dress dealers) ;-) .

Especially in some nontrivial context as here, concepts and solutions come in different flavours (or 'sizes').

## Overview
* *[SSSS](ssss/ReadMe.md)*	super small & simple (& stupid)
* *[SSS](sss/ReadMe.md)*	super small & simple
* *[SS](ss/ReadMe.md)*	super simple
* *[S](s/ReadMe.md)* 	supply-driven channel types (think: easy, push, provide, eager)

---
* *[L](l/ReadMe.md)* 	demand-driven channel types (think: lazy, poll, request, demand, sleuth)

---
* *[XS](xs/ReadMe.md)*	eXtended (with Context and functionality) easy supply-driven channel types 
* *[XL](xl/ReadMe.md)*	eXtended (with Context and functionality) lazy demand-driven channel types

Note:
* In order to keep things easy in the beginning, You may start with the supply-driven kind!
* Some people believe, _SSS_ is easier to understand and to reason about.
* Thus: _SSS_ might be more appropiate for smaller minds ... never mind ;-)

Note:
* _S_ and _L_ are just symmetric opposites
* In order to bridge/convert between _S_ and _L_, we might also have *SL* (like the famous Mercedes sport-car) for those, who need to freely mix supply-driven and demand-driven channels.
