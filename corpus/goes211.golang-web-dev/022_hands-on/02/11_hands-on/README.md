# Building upon the code from the previous problem:

Before we WRITE our RESPONSE , let's WRITE to our RESPONSE the STATUS LINE and some REPONSE HEADERS. Remember the request line and status line:

REQUEST LINE
GET / HTTP/1.1
method SP request-target SP HTTP-version CRLF
https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7230#section-3.1.1

RESPONSE (STATUS) LINE
HTTP/1.1 302 Found
HTTP-version SP status-code SP reason-phrase CRLF
https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7230#section-3.1.2

Write the following strings to the response - use io.WriteString for all of the following except the second and third:

"HTTP/1.1 200 OK\r\n"

fmt.Fprintf(c, "Content-Length: %d\r\n", len(body))

fmt.Fprint(c, "Content-Type: text/plain\r\n")

"\r\n"

Look in your browser "developer tools" under the network tab. Compare the RESPONSE HEADERS from the previous file with the RESPONSE HEADERS in your new solution.
