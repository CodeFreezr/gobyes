The moonlight was still there, on the dashboard,
though the driver's side window was broken
and my wife's purse was gone.

The thief,
what else did he take?

Perhaps the childhood of someone
who wasn't raised well, a young man
without the good fortune to receive guidance
or to be helped with his homework
or to be directed towards school.

Perhaps the thief took the love too
that this young man was meant to receive.

I think of Hank and Jodi
with a grandchild
who has leukemia.

We drive home with the heat on.
The air at night in winter is cold.

What is a purse,
what is a broken window,
when compared to these things?
