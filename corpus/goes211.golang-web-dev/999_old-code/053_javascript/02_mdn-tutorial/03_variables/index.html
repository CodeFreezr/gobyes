<h1>Open Your Console</h1>

<ol>
    <li>Make sure you're using google chrome</li>
    <li>Right click your webpage</li>
    <li>Select "inspect"</li>
    <li>Click the "console" tab</li>
    <li>Refresh your webpage</li>
</ol>

<p>
    Note: All statements in JavaScript must end with a semi-colon, to indicate that this is where the statement ends. If you don't include these, you can get unexpected results.
</p>

<p>    Note: You can name a variable nearly anything, but there are some name restrictions (see this article on variable naming rules.) If you are unsure, you can check your variable name to see if it is valid.</p>

<p>
    Note: JavaScript is case sensitive â€” myVariable is a different variable to myvariable. If you are getting problems in your code, check the casing!</p>

    var myVariable;

    var myNewVariable = 'Stacey';
    console.log(myNewVariable);

    myNewVariable = 'Shelley';
