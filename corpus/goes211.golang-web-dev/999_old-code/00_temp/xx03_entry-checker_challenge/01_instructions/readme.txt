In this challenge, you will create an application which demonstrates AJAX.

Create an "is the name already taken" app.

Users can enter words in a form field.

The words will be stored in either memcache or the datastore.

If the word is already stored, a message will display on the webpage letting the user know that word is already stored.

Begin with the code in this folder.

Try to build the code yourself before looking at the solution.

If you are stuck, look at previous examples.

If you are completely stuck, read through the solution for understanding.
