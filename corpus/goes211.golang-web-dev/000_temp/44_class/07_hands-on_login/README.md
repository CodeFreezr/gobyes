Using the code in the "starting-code" folder:

- create a login page
- process a successful login for these credentials:
  - username: james@bond.com
  - password: notstirred
  
Please note:
- a Password field has been added to the user struct
- dbUser is populated in func init

You do not need to protect any pages. Every page is accessible to everyone regardless of whether or not they're logged in.

Do not worry about abstracting code. You may notice redundant code. This is fine.
