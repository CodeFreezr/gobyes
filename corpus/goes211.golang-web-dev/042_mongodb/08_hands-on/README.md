# Use a map

Use the code in the previous folder "07_solution".

There is a map that holds all of the user data.

Every time a user is created or deleted, write this map as JSON to a file.

Also, when your program starts, if there is a file with JSON data in it, load that data.

IMPORTANT:
Make sure you update your import statements to import packages from the correct location!
