 user defined types - we declare a new type, foo
 the underlying type of foo: int

 conversion:int(myAge)
 converting type foo to type int

 THIS CODE IS ONLY FOR EXAMPLE
 IT IS A BAD PRACTICE TO ALIAS TYPES
 one exception: if you need to attach methods to a type
 see the time package for an example of this
     godoc.org/time
     type Duration int64
 Duration has methods attached to it
