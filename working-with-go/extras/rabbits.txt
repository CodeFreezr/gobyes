Rabbits are small mammals in the family Leporidae of the order Lagomorpha,
found in several parts of the world. There are eight different genera in the
family classified as rabbits, including the European rabbit (Oryctolagus
cuniculus), cottontail rabbits (genus Sylvilagus; 13 species), and the Amami
rabbit (Pentalagus furnessi, an endangered species on Amami ÅŒshima, Japan).

There are many other species of rabbit, and these, along with pikas and hares,
make up the order Lagomorpha. The male is called a buck and the female is a
doe; a young rabbit is a kitten or kit.

Rabbit habitats include meadows, woods, forests, grasslands, deserts and
wetlands. Rabbits live in groups, and the best known species, the European
rabbit, lives in underground burrows, or rabbit holes. A group of burrows is
called a warren.

More than half the world's rabbit population resides in North America. They
are also native to southwestern Europe, Southeast Asia, Sumatra, some islands
of Japan, and in parts of Africa and South America. They are not naturally
found in most of Eurasia, where a number of species of hares are present.
Rabbits first entered South America relatively recently, as part of the Great
American Interchange. Much of the continent has just one species of rabbit, the
tapeti, while most of South America's southern cone is without rabbits.

The European rabbit has been introduced to many places around the world.
