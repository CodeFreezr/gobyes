# Go Cookbook

# What is this?

This is a collection of recipes for the Go language. It aims to distill the knowledge of the Go community into simple and clear examples of best practice.

# Where do the recipes come from?

Some of the recipes have their origins in threads on the Go Nuts mailing list [go-nuts](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/golang-nuts). Others are distilled from existing open source code, the Go source code and sources such as the [Go Wiki](http://code.google.com/p/go-wiki/).

# There seems to be no organisation...

At the moment, while there are very few recipes, I am just leaving the recipes unorganised. When there are enough I will start grouping and tagging them and provide an index into the cookbook. At that point I may add the necessary config to make this content publishable using a system like Jekyll (or [Hastie](https://github.com/mkaz/hastie))


# Can I reuse the recipes?

Yes. All content in this Go Cookbook is made available via the [CC0 public domain license](http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/). See [`LICENSE`](LICENSE)


# How can I contribute?

You can edit a recipe or contribute a new one by submitting a pull request. Please limit each pull request to a single recipe so it's easy to manage and discuss. Feel free to add yourself to the [`CREDITS`](CREDITS) file if you wish. Don't add yourself to the [`AUTHORS`](AUTHORS) file. If your contribution is deemed substantial enough then one of the existing authors will add you.

Do note that in order for any non-trivial changes to be merged (as a rule of thumb, additions larger than about 5 lines), an explicit Public Domain Dedication needs to be on record from you. Please include a copy of the statement found in the [`WAIVER`](WAIVER) file with your pull request.

# Can I suggest new recipes?

Yes. Open a [new issue](https://github.com/iand/gocookbook/issues/new) and write your suggestion there. Add the 'recipe suggestion' label to help people who want to contribute to find ideas for recipes.
